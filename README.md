## üåü Featured Projects:

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of. You can find their repositories linked below!

### [Intelligent Medical Chatbot](Your-Repo-Link-Here)
I engineered a sophisticated, knowledge-based recommender system that delivers tailored medical advice. By fine-tuning a chatbot with extensive medical datasets and harnessing the power of Azure's OpenAI API and Langchain's RAG technique, I created a system that provides precise and context-aware responses. This project showcases my ability to build specialized AI applications that can make a real-world impact.
